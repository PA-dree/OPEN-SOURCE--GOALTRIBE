# OPEN SOURCE :PROTOTYPE
A goal-setting and habit-tracking app with social accountability features, tentatively named "GoalTribe".

# The GoalTribe Android application is designed to help users achieve personal goals
through habit tracking, gamification, and social accountability. It enables users to set
goals, track progress, and stay motivated by joining “Tribes” — groups of friends who
share progress, encourage one another, and take part in group challenges.
The main objectives of the app are to help users build consistent habits, create a sense of
community, make goal achievement rewarding, and promote social impact by donating
earned coins to charities.

# Design Considerations
User Interface and Experience: Built using Jetpack Compose for a modern design, with
a motivational color scheme, simple layout, and bilingual support (English and isiZulu).
Architecture and Functionality: Implements MVVM architecture with Room Database,
Firebase Authentication, and a custom REST API for tribe management and
synchronization.
Security and Reliability: Data encryption, secure authentication, and automatic syncing
ensure privacy and consistency.

# Utilisation of GitHub and GitHub Actions
GitHub for Version Control: GitHub was used for source control, with commits,
branches, and version tracking to ensure organized collaboration and rollback safety.
GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration: Automated Gradle builds and unit tests run
on each push or pull request, improving reliability and catching issues early.
The integration of GitHub Actions improved build quality, testing consistency, and saved
development time.
